# Data-Analysis

I completed an 8 week intensive BootCamp with JustIT on Data Analysis. These are the Topics we covered and the outcomes:


# Excel
In the first week of the BootCamp, we took on Excel including Data relevant legislation (GDPR, Data Protection and Freedom of Information Act and the Computer Misuse Act).

# Power BI
I found Power BI more intuitive than Tableau... etc. SQL?


# SQL
relentless practical exercises until i ended up dreaming about writing SQL queries in the night. strangely the next day, SQL felt a lot more intuitive.
screenshots of SQL code including queried data. workbook embed?

# Python
Throughout the BootCamp I took it upon myself to work through as many DataCamp courses as possible in preparation for when we'd delve into Python. During Python week I then spent two days powering through the extensive Cisco Programming Foundations Course (correct name). As part of these programs I learned about the very foundations of coding

should i add ATM and whizzbuss as code files to repo instead of in readme?
