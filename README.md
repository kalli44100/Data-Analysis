# Data-Analysis

I completed an 8 week intensive BootCamp with JustIT on Data Analysis. These are the Topics we covered and the outcomes:

### Excel
In the first week of the BootCamp, we took on Excel including Data relevant legislation (GDPR, Data Protection and Freedom of Information Act and the Computer Misuse Act).

### Python
Throughout the BootCamp I took it upon myself to work through as many DataCamp courses as possible in preparation for when we'd get to Python. During Python week I then spent two days powering through the extensive Cisco Python Essentials 1 Course ([Certificate](https://www.credly.com/badges/3496a9b7-b60d-400c-a8d1-b161e407ab1d/public_url)). As part of these programs I learned about the very foundations of coding which had eluded me throughout my years of self-guided custom software programming. This has really helped me grasp fundamental concepts such as Compiling, Binary, File and Code structure (__init__ files; modules,classes and methods...). I have attached to this repo two simple apps we made as part of the curriculum (ATM and FizzBuzz).

Alongside the BootCamp I also completed a number of DataCamp courses on Python and SQL

### Azure
We delved into the vast expanse of the Azure cloud hosting services. As part of the curriculum, we completed the DP900 Syllabus (Now I just need to sign up to the official exam). Azure can provide an accessible and seamlessly complete service for businesses and their data needs and we learned to become comfortable with its unique terminology. Please find my Azure specific Workbook attached to this repo.

### Tableau
In week 2 we got to know Tableau and Power BI and learned how to present Data in a comprehensible and arguably beautiful format.

### Power BI
I found Power BI more intuitive than Tableau (or perhaps the learning curve was just less steep since we learned Tableau first and PowerBI second). I felt that it was perhaps more customisable, although when it comes to Visualisation and ease of sharing, Tableau would probably come out ahead.

### SQL
Our instructor had us go through countless exercises relentlessly practicing SQL queries to the point where I dreamt about writing SQL code. The next day, SQL felt a lot more intuitive (You know how they say that when you learn a new language, it's when you dream in that new language, you know you have arrived!). Please take a look at the SQL_Workbook file attached to this repository for further details of what we did including a final project that had us apply SQL in a real world business context.

### Other
In order to track my progress (and potentially help others on the same project I am doing) I built this data tracking and visualisation app
